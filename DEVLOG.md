# VABitNet Development Log

## 2025-10-25 - Initial Fork Setup

### Objective
Create a Windows 11-friendly fork of Microsoft BitNet that can run without requiring end users to install C++ build tools.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Repository Setup
- Cloned from `cyber3pxVA/VABitNet` (forked from `frasod/BitNet`)
- Initialized Git LFS for model file handling
- Initialized all submodules (`3rdparty/llama.cpp`)

#### 2. Removed Dev Container
- Deleted `.devcontainer/` directory
- Project now focuses on native Windows setup with optional pre-built binaries

#### 3. Python Environment Setup
- Created Python 3.9+ virtual environment (`venv/`)
- Installed dependencies:
  - PyTorch 2.5.1 (CPU-only build - no CUDA required)
  - NumPy 2.1.3
  - Transformers 4.46.3
  - Sentencepiece, Safetensors, etc.
- All packages installed without requiring C++ build tools

#### 4. Model Download via Git LFS
- Downloaded `1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-large` (0.7B parameters) to `models/`
- Used Git LFS clone instead of Hugging Face API
- Model size: ~2.7GB downloaded successfully

#### 5. Created Setup Scripts

**quick_setup.ps1**
- End-user setup script (no build tools required)
- Checks for Git LFS
- Creates venv and installs Python dependencies
- Validates pre-built binaries exist
- Provides usage instructions

**build_windows.ps1**
- Developer build script
- Validates VS Developer environment
- Checks for CMake and Clang
- Builds project using `setup_env.py`
- Provides instructions for committing binaries

**WINDOWS_BUILD_SETUP.md**
- Comprehensive build environment setup guide
- Multiple installation options (VS2022, Chocolatey, Manual)
- Step-by-step build instructions
- Binary commit workflow

**README_VABITNET.md**
- Fork-specific README
- Quick start guide for end users
- Pre-built binaries explanation
- Differences from original BitNet

#### 6. Git Configuration
- Created `.gitattributes` for proper binary handling
- Configured line ending handling for cross-platform compatibility
- Set up binary file tracking for `.exe`, `.dll`, `.gguf`, etc.

### Architecture Decisions

#### Why Pre-built Binaries?
- BitNet requires CMake + Clang/MSVC to compile llama.cpp-based inference engine
- Most Windows users don't have build tools installed (~7GB download)
- Pre-compiling binaries eliminates this barrier
- Binaries can be committed to repo (~50-100MB)

#### Build Strategy
- Build on machine with VS 2022 installed
- Commit compiled binaries to `build/bin/Release/`
- End users clone repo with binaries included
- Python scripts use pre-built binaries directly

#### Model Distribution
- Use Git LFS for model files (not Hugging Face API)
- Models stored in separate `models/` directory
- Each model in own subdirectory with GGUF files
- Avoids Python API authentication issues

### Current Status

#### âœ… Completed
- [x] Repository cloned and configured
- [x] Dev container removed
- [x] Python venv created and dependencies installed
- [x] Git LFS configured and model downloaded
- [x] Setup scripts created
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] Git attributes configured

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Build binaries with Visual Studio 2022
- [ ] Test inference with pre-built binaries
- [ ] Commit binaries to repository
- [ ] Push changes to remote

#### ðŸ“‹ Todo
- [ ] Test quick_setup.ps1 on clean machine
- [ ] Add more model download examples
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions for automated builds
- [ ] Add troubleshooting section to docs
- [ ] Test on different Windows 11 configurations

### Technical Notes

#### Supported Models
Currently tested with:
- `1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-large` (0.7B) - âœ… Downloaded
- `1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-3B` (3.3B) - Not yet tested
- `HF1BitLLM/Llama3-8B-1.58-100B-tokens` (8B) - Not yet tested

#### Build Requirements (Developer Only)
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ tools
- CMake 3.22+
- Clang/ClangCL
- Python 3.9+
- Git LFS

#### Runtime Requirements (End User)
- Windows 11
- Python 3.9+
- Git with LFS
- ~4GB RAM minimum (for 0.7B model)
- ~8GB RAM recommended (for 3B model)

### Next Session Tasks
1. Open Developer PowerShell for VS 2022
2. Run `.\build_windows.ps1` to compile binaries
3. Test inference with compiled binaries
4. Commit binaries and push to repo
5. Test fresh clone on another machine (if available)

### Known Issues
- None yet

### Performance Notes
- To be added after first successful inference run
- Will benchmark on Windows 11 with available CPU

---

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions CI/CD for automated binary builds
- [ ] Create Windows installer (MSI/EXE)
- [ ] Add GPU support documentation
- [ ] Benchmark different CPU architectures
- [ ] Add more example inference scripts
- [ ] Create GUI wrapper (optional)
