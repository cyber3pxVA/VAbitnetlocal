# VABitNet Development Log

## 2025-10-25 - Initial Fork Setup

### Objective
Create a Windows 11-friendly fork of Microsoft BitNet that can run without requiring end users to install C++ build tools.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Repository Setup
- Cloned from `cyber3pxVA/VABitNet` (forked from `frasod/BitNet`)
- Initialized Git LFS for model file handling
- Initialized all submodules (`3rdparty/llama.cpp`)

#### 2. Removed Dev Container
- Deleted `.devcontainer/` directory
- Project now focuses on native Windows setup with optional pre-built binaries

#### 3. Python Environment Setup
- Created Python 3.9+ virtual environment (`venv/`)
- Installed dependencies:
  - PyTorch 2.5.1 (CPU-only build - no CUDA required)
  - NumPy 2.1.3
  - Transformers 4.46.3
  - Sentencepiece, Safetensors, etc.
- All packages installed without requiring C++ build tools

#### 4. Model Download via Git LFS
- Downloaded `1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-large` (0.7B parameters) to `models/`
- Used Git LFS clone instead of Hugging Face API
- Model size: ~2.7GB downloaded successfully

#### 5. Created Setup Scripts

**quick_setup.ps1**
- End-user setup script (no build tools required)
- Checks for Git LFS
- Creates venv and installs Python dependencies
- Validates pre-built binaries exist
- Provides usage instructions

**build_windows.ps1**
- Developer build script
- Validates VS Developer environment
- Checks for CMake and Clang
- Builds project using `setup_env.py`
- Provides instructions for committing binaries

**WINDOWS_BUILD_SETUP.md**
- Comprehensive build environment setup guide
- Multiple installation options (VS2022, Chocolatey, Manual)
- Step-by-step build instructions
- Binary commit workflow

**README_VABITNET.md**
- Fork-specific README
- Quick start guide for end users
- Pre-built binaries explanation
- Differences from original BitNet

#### 6. Git Configuration
- Created `.gitattributes` for proper binary handling
- Configured line ending handling for cross-platform compatibility
- Set up binary file tracking for `.exe`, `.dll`, `.gguf`, etc.

### Architecture Decisions

#### Why Pre-built Binaries?
- BitNet requires CMake + Clang/MSVC to compile llama.cpp-based inference engine
- Most Windows users don't have build tools installed (~7GB download)
- Pre-compiling binaries eliminates this barrier
- Binaries can be committed to repo (~50-100MB)

#### Build Strategy
- Build on machine with VS 2022 installed
- Commit compiled binaries to `build/bin/Release/`
- End users clone repo with binaries included
- Python scripts use pre-built binaries directly

#### Model Distribution
- Use Git LFS for model files (not Hugging Face API)
- Models stored in separate `models/` directory
- Each model in own subdirectory with GGUF files
- Avoids Python API authentication issues

### Current Status

#### âœ… Completed
- [x] Repository cloned and configured
- [x] Dev container removed
- [x] Python venv created and dependencies installed
- [x] Git LFS configured and model downloaded
- [x] Setup scripts created
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] Git attributes configured

#### âœ… Build Success (2025-10-26)
- [x] Build binaries with Visual Studio 2022 + LLVM/Clang 21.1.4
- [x] Fixed C++ chrono header issues in llama.cpp submodule
- [x] Compiled all 35 executables successfully (26.5MB total)
- [x] Created BUILD_NOW.bat for reliable CMD execution
- [x] Committed binaries to repository

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Test inference with pre-built binaries
- [ ] Push changes to remote

#### ðŸ“‹ Todo
- [ ] Test quick_setup.ps1 on clean machine
- [ ] Add more model download examples
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions for automated builds
- [ ] Test on different Windows 11 configurations

### Technical Notes

#### Supported Models
Currently tested with:
- `1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-large` (0.7B) - âœ… Downloaded
- `1bitLLM/bitnet_b1_58-3B` (3.3B) - Not yet tested
- `HF1BitLLM/Llama3-8B-1.58-100B-tokens` (8B) - Not yet tested

#### Build Requirements (Developer Only)
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ tools
- CMake 3.22+
- Clang/ClangCL
- Python 3.9+
- Git LFS

#### Runtime Requirements (End User)
- Windows 11
- Python 3.9+
- Git with LFS
- ~4GB RAM minimum (for 0.7B model)
- ~8GB RAM recommended (for 3B model)

### Next Session Tasks
1. Open Developer PowerShell for VS 2022
2. Run `.\build_windows.ps1` to compile binaries
3. Test inference with compiled binaries
4. Commit binaries and push to repo
5. Test fresh clone on another machine (if available)

### Known Issues
- None yet

### Performance Notes
- To be added after first successful inference run
- Will benchmark on Windows 11 with available CPU

## 2025-10-26 - Successful Windows Build

### Build Environment
- **Platform:** Windows 11 build 10.0.26200.6901
- **Compiler:** LLVM/Clang 21.1.4 (clang++)
- **Build System:** CMake 4.1.2 + Ninja 1.13.1
- **Visual Studio:** 2022 Build Tools (for MSVC headers/libraries)

### Key Issues Resolved

#### Problem: C++ Chrono Header Missing
**Symptom:** `error: no member named 'system_clock' in namespace 'std::chrono'`

**Root Cause:** 
- clang++ on Windows uses MSVC standard library headers
- Some llama.cpp files relied on transitive includes (e.g., `<thread>` â†’ `<chrono>`)
- C++20 standard was set but chrono symbols still not found
- Required explicit `#include <chrono>` directive

**Files Fixed:**
1. `3rdparty/llama.cpp/common/log.cpp` - Added `#include <chrono>` at line 3
2. `3rdparty/llama.cpp/common/common.cpp` - Added `#include <chrono>` at line 14
3. `3rdparty/llama.cpp/examples/imatrix/imatrix.cpp` - Added `#include <chrono>` at line 6
4. `3rdparty/llama.cpp/examples/perplexity/perplexity.cpp` - Added `#include <chrono>` at line 9

**Solution Steps:**
1. Created test file `test_chrono.cpp` to verify clang++ could compile chrono code
2. Searched for all `std::chrono` usage in llama.cpp submodule
3. Added explicit includes to 4 source files
4. Committed fixes to llama.cpp submodule

#### Problem: VS Code PowerShell Terminal Glitches
**Symptom:** Build process randomly interrupted, appearing as if Ctrl+C was pressed

**Solution:** Run BUILD_NOW.bat in standalone CMD window instead of VS Code integrated terminal

### Build Configuration
```cmake
cmake -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DBITNET_X86_TL2=ON \
  -DCMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY="MultiThreaded" \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=20
```

### Build Results

**Compilation:** 120/120 files compiled successfully
- Warnings present (unused parameters, format specifiers, GNU extensions) - all harmless
- No errors encountered

**Executables Created:** 35 binaries in `build/bin/` (26.5MB total)

Key binaries:
- `llama-cli.exe` (1.01MB) - Main inference CLI
- `llama-server.exe` (2.18MB) - HTTP API server
- `llama-quantize.exe` (289KB) - Model quantization tool
- `llama-perplexity.exe` (1.10MB) - Perplexity benchmark
- `llama-imatrix.exe` (1.01MB) - Importance matrix calculation
- Plus 30 additional utilities

**Verification:** All binaries tested successfully
- `llama-cli.exe --version` output: `version: 3960 (40ed0f29)`
- Built for: `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

### Files Committed
- **Binaries:** All 35 executables in `build/bin/`
- **Build Scripts:** BUILD_NOW.bat, build_windows.ps1, quick_setup.ps1
- **Documentation:** DEVLOG.md, README_VABITNET.md, WINDOWS_BUILD_SETUP.md
- **Configuration:** .gitattributes, CMakeLists.txt updates, setup_env.py changes
- **Submodule:** llama.cpp with chrono header fixes
- **Cleanup:** Removed .devcontainer/

### Build Time
Approximately 3-5 minutes for full clean build on Windows 11

### Next Steps
1. Test inference with downloaded bitnet_b1_58-large model
2. Push changes to GitHub repository
3. Verify end-user experience with quick_setup.ps1
